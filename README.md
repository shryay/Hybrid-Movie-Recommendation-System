# 🎬 Hybrid Movie Recommendation System

## 🚀 Overview

The Hybrid Movie Recommendation System combines **Content-Based Filtering** and **Collaborative Filtering** to deliver personalized, accurate movie suggestions. By analyzing movie metadata (🎭 genres, 🎬 cast, 🎦 director, 📖 plot) and user interactions (⭐ ratings, 🕒 watch history), our system tackles repetitive recommendations and cold start problems.

## 🌟 Features

- 🤖 **Hybrid Engine**: Integrates content similarity (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity) and collaborative filtering (SVD) for robust recommendations.
- 🧊 **Cold Start & Sparsity Solutions**: Reduces limitations found in single-method systems.
- 🖥️ **Interactive UI**: Presents recommendations for a user or movie.
- 📊 **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates using RMSE, MAE, and relevance scores.

2. 🔍 **Content-Based Filtering**: Finds similar movies by features.
3. 🤝 **Collaborative Filtering**: Predicts user ratings with SVD.
4. 🧩 **Hybrid Integration**: Combines and ranks recommendations for diversity and relevance.
